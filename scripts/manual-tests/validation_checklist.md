# Validation Checklist for SalesAPI Manual Tests

## ? Pre-Test Validation

### Environment Setup
- [ ] All services are running (Gateway: 6000, Inventory: 5000, Sales: 5001)
- [ ] SQL Server is accessible on localhost:1433
- [ ] RabbitMQ is running on localhost:5672
- [ ] All dependencies (curl, jq) are available
- [ ] Test results directory is writable
- [ ] Network connectivity is working

### Service Health
- [ ] Gateway returns 200 on `/gateway/status`
- [ ] Inventory API returns 200 on `/health`
- [ ] Sales API returns 200 on `/health`
- [ ] All services respond within acceptable time limits (< 5 seconds)

## ? Authentication & Authorization

### Basic Authentication
- [ ] Can obtain admin JWT token with valid credentials
- [ ] Can obtain customer JWT token with valid credentials
- [ ] Invalid credentials return 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Missing credentials return 400 Bad Request
- [ ] JWT tokens have valid structure (3 parts separated by dots)

### Role-Based Access Control
- [ ] Admin can create/update/delete products
- [ ] Customers cannot create/update/delete products (403 Forbidden)
- [ ] Customers can create orders
- [ ] Unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints return 401
- [ ] Read operations (GET) work without authentication

## ? Product Management

### CRUD Operations
- [ ] Can create products with valid data (admin only)
- [ ] Can retrieve individual products by ID (public access)
- [ ] Can list products with pagination (public access)
- [ ] Can update existing products (admin only)
- [ ] Can delete products (admin only)

### Data Validation
- [ ] Rejects products with empty/null names
- [ ] Rejects products with negative prices
- [ ] Rejects products with negative stock quantities
- [ ] Handles very long product names appropriately
- [ ] Returns proper error messages for validation failures

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Returns 404 for non-existent product IDs
- [ ] Handles invalid GUID formats appropriately
- [ ] Processes pagination parameters correctly
- [ ] Rejects invalid pagination parameters (page <= 0, pageSize <= 0)

## ? Order Management

### Order Creation
- [ ] Can create orders with valid customer tokens
- [ ] Cannot create orders without authentication (401)
- [ ] Validates required fields (customerId, items)
- [ ] Rejects orders with empty items array
- [ ] Rejects orders with negative quantities
- [ ] Returns proper order details after creation

### Order Operations
- [ ] Can retrieve orders by ID (public access)
- [ ] Can list orders with pagination (public access)
- [ ] Can confirm orders (authenticated users)
- [ ] Can cancel orders with reason (authenticated users)
- [ ] Can mark orders as fulfilled (authenticated users)

### Business Logic
- [ ] Payment simulation works (low prices succeed, high prices may fail)
- [ ] Order status transitions are handled correctly
- [ ] Stock is reserved when orders are created
- [ ] Stock is released when orders are cancelled

## ? Stock Reservation System

### Reservation Creation
- [ ] Can create stock reservations directly via API (admin)
- [ ] Reservations are created automatically during order creation
- [ ] Cannot create reservations for non-existent products
- [ ] Cannot create reservations exceeding available stock
- [ ] Prevents duplicate reservations for the same order (idempotency)

### Reservation Queries
- [ ] Can query reservations by order ID
- [ ] Can query individual reservations by ID
- [ ] Returns 404 for non-existent reservations
- [ ] Requires authentication for reservation queries

### Stock Consistency
- [ ] Stock quantities are updated correctly after reservations
- [ ] Concurrent reservations don't cause overselling
- [ ] Stock is released when orders are cancelled
- [ ] Final stock matches expected values after operations

## ? Event-Driven Architecture

### Event Publishing
- [ ] Order events are published to RabbitMQ
- [ ] Stock reservation events are published
- [ ] Event processing doesn't block API responses
- [ ] Events contain proper correlation IDs

### Event Processing
- [ ] Order confirmation events update stock quantities
- [ ] Order cancellation events release reservations
- [ ] Event processing is idempotent
- [ ] Failed events are handled gracefully

## ? API Gateway Functionality

### Routing
- [ ] Requests to `/inventory/*` are routed to Inventory API
- [ ] Requests to `/sales/*` are routed to Sales API
- [ ] Authentication endpoints work through gateway
- [ ] Health check endpoints are accessible

### Load Balancing & Health
- [ ] Gateway performs health checks on backend services
- [ ] Unhealthy services are marked appropriately
- [ ] Routing continues to work with multiple instances

## ? Data Consistency & Integrity

### Transaction Management
- [ ] Database operations are atomic
- [ ] Failed operations don't leave partial data
- [ ] Concurrent operations maintain data integrity
- [ ] Cross-service consistency is maintained

### Audit Trail
- [ ] All operations are properly logged
- [ ] Correlation IDs are maintained across services
- [ ] Timestamps are accurate and consistent
- [ ] User context is preserved in audit logs

## ? Error Handling & Resilience

### HTTP Status Codes
- [ ] 200/201 for successful operations
- [ ] 400 for client validation errors
- [ ] 401 for authentication failures
- [ ] 403 for authorization failures
- [ ] 404 for resource not found
- [ ] 422 for business logic violations
- [ ] 500 for server errors

### Error Messages
- [ ] Error responses contain meaningful messages
- [ ] Validation errors specify which fields are invalid
- [ ] Business rule violations are clearly explained
- [ ] Internal errors don't expose sensitive information

### Resilience
- [ ] Services handle temporary failures gracefully
- [ ] Timeouts are configured appropriately
- [ ] Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
- [ ] Retries work for transient errors

## ? Performance & Scalability

### Response Times
- [ ] Health checks respond within 1 second
- [ ] CRUD operations complete within 5 seconds
- [ ] Complex operations (orders with reservations) complete within 10 seconds
- [ ] Paginated queries handle large datasets efficiently

### Concurrency
- [ ] Multiple users can operate simultaneously
- [ ] Race conditions are prevented
- [ ] Database locks don't cause deadlocks
- [ ] System remains stable under load

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable and stable
- [ ] CPU usage doesn't spike excessively
- [ ] Database connections are managed properly
- [ ] No resource leaks detected

## ? Security

### Authentication Security
- [ ] JWT tokens expire appropriately (1 hour default)
- [ ] Tokens contain necessary claims but no sensitive data
- [ ] Password policies are enforced (if applicable)
- [ ] Session management is secure

### Data Security
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged
- [ ] SQL injection is prevented
- [ ] Input validation prevents XSS
- [ ] Authorization is consistently enforced

### Communication Security
- [ ] HTTPS is used in production environments
- [ ] API keys/tokens are transmitted securely
- [ ] CORS policies are appropriately configured
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse

## ? Monitoring & Observability

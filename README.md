# SalesAPI - Complete Microservices Architecture with Docker Compose & Advanced Observability

A production-ready microservices-based e-commerce solution built with .NET 8, featuring containerized deployment, inventory management, sales processing with **advanced stock reservations**, API Gateway with YARP reverse proxy, JWT authentication with role-based authorization, **fully functional event-driven architecture with RabbitMQ**, Saga pattern implementation, **comprehensive observability with correlation tracking**, and comprehensive automated testing.

## ?? **NEW! Complete Observability - Etapa 7** 

### **?? End-to-End Request Tracing**
Track every request across all microservices with unique correlation IDs:

```
Client Request ? Gateway ? Sales API ? Inventory API ? Stock Reservation
     ?              ?         ?           ?              ?
 [correlation]  [correlation] [correlation] [correlation] [correlation]
  my-trace-123   my-trace-123  my-trace-123  my-trace-123  my-trace-123
```

### **?? Production-Ready Monitoring**
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent format across all services with correlation context
- **Prometheus Metrics**: HTTP metrics, custom business metrics, health monitoring  
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Live correlation tracking through distributed operations
- **Docker-Native**: Full observability in containerized environments

### **?? Quick Observability Test**
```bash
# Start system with observability
docker compose -f docker-compose-observability-simple.yml up -d

# Test correlation tracking
.\test-observability-complete.ps1

# Expected Result: ? Same correlation ID across all services
```

## ?? **Observability Features Deep Dive**

### **?? Complete Request Tracing**
Every request is tracked with a unique correlation ID that flows through all services:

```
[15:30:45] ?? Gateway    | abc-123 | POST /sales/orders started
[15:30:45] ?? Sales      | abc-123 | Order creation for Customer xyz
[15:30:46] ?? Inventory  | abc-123 | Stock reservation for Product 456  
[15:30:46] ?? Sales      | abc-123 | Order created successfully: Order 789
[15:30:46] ?? Gateway    | abc-123 | Request completed in 234ms
```

### **?? Structured Logging with Correlation**
- **Consistent Format**: Timestamp, service emoji, correlation ID, message
- **Rich Context**: Request details, timing, business operations
- **Error Correlation**: Failed operations tracked with same correlation ID
- **Performance Insights**: Request duration and service interaction timing

### **?? Prometheus Metrics Integration**
| Service | Metrics Endpoint | Key Metrics |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Gateway** | http://localhost:6000/metrics | Request rates, proxy performance |
| **Inventory** | http://localhost:5000/metrics | Stock operations, reservation metrics |
| **Sales** | http://localhost:5001/metrics | Order processing, payment simulation |
| **Prometheus** | http://localhost:9090 | Centralized metrics collection |

### **?? Cross-Service Communication Tracking**
- **HTTP Header Propagation**: X-Correlation-Id automatically propagated
- **Stock Reservation Flow**: Complete tracing through reservation workflow
- **Event Publishing**: Correlation context included in domain events
- **Error Propagation**: Failed operations maintain correlation context

## ?? Quick Start with Enhanced Observability

### **?? Super Quick Start - One Command Deployment with Observability**

```bash
# Start complete system with observability (RECOMMENDED)
docker compose -f docker-compose-observability-simple.yml up -d

# Start with Prometheus metrics collection  
docker compose -f docker-compose-observability-simple.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d

# Test complete observability
.\test-observability-complete.ps1
```

### **?? Validate Observability Features**

```powershell
# Test correlation tracking
$correlationId = "my-test-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddHHmmss')"

# Make authenticated request with correlation
$token = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:6000/auth/token' `
  -Method Post -Headers @{'X-Correlation-Id'=$correlationId} `
  -Body '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}').accessToken

# Create product with correlation tracking
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:6000/inventory/products' `
  -Method Post -Headers @{'Authorization'="Bearer $token"; 'X-Correlation-Id'=$correlationId} `
  -Body '{"name":"Test Product","price":99.99,"stockQuantity":50}'

# Check correlation in logs across all services
docker compose logs | Select-String $correlationId
```

### **?? Observability Endpoints**

| Service | Health Check | Metrics | Correlation Support |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Gateway** | http://localhost:6000/health | http://localhost:6000/metrics | ? Generator + Propagator |
| **Inventory** | http://localhost:5000/health | http://localhost:5000/metrics | ? Receiver + Tracker |
| **Sales** | http://localhost:5001/health | http://localhost:5001/metrics | ? Receiver + Propagator |
| **Prometheus** | - | http://localhost:9090 | ? Metrics Aggregation |

### **? Expected Observability Results**

When you run the observability tests, you should see:

```
? Correlation ID: obs-test-20250825123739-3291
? Health endpoints: 3/3 responding
? Metrics endpoints: 3/3 accessible
? Authentication: Working with correlation
? Cross-service operations: Working with correlation

## ?? Event-Driven Architecture Deep Dive

### **?? Real Message Flow**

```
Order Created ? Sales API ? RabbitMQ ? Inventory API ? Stock Deducted
     ?              ?          ?           ?              ?
[OrderConfirmed] [Publish]  [Queue]   [Consume]     [Process]
     Event       via Rebus  inventory  Handler       Database
```

### **?? Production Event Processing**

1. **Event Publishing (Sales API)**:
   ```csharp
   // Real RabbitMQ publishing via Rebus
   await _bus.Publish(new OrderConfirmedEvent
   {
       OrderId = order.Id,
       Items = orderItems,
       CorrelationId = correlationId
   });
   ```

2. **Event Consumption (Inventory API)**:
   ```csharp
   // Automatic handler registration and processing
   public class OrderConfirmedEventHandler : IHandleMessages<OrderConfirmedEvent>
   {
       public async Task Handle(OrderConfirmedEvent orderEvent)
       {
           // Idempotency check + stock deduction + audit trail
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Idempotency Protection**:
   ```csharp
   // Prevent duplicate processing
   var existingEvent = await _dbContext.ProcessedEvents
       .FirstOrDefaultAsync(pe => pe.EventId == orderEvent.EventId);
   ```

### **??? Error Handling & Resilience**

- **Automatic Retries**: Rebus handles transient failures
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed messages moved to error queues
- **Circuit Breaker**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- **Correlation Tracking**: Error correlation across service boundaries

## ?? Observability Monitoring & Operations

### **Real-Time Correlation Tracking**

```bash
# Follow correlated logs across all services
docker compose logs -f | grep "correlation_id_here"

# Monitor specific correlation flow
$correlationId = "trace-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddHHmmss')"
# Use $correlationId in requests and track across logs
```

### **Prometheus Metrics Examples**

```prometheus
# HTTP request rate by service
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Request duration by endpoint
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# Service health status
up{job=~"salesapi-.*"}

# Correlation ID usage rate
rate(correlation_middleware_requests_total[5m])
```

### **Key Observability Metrics**

- **Correlation Coverage**: Percentage of requests with correlation IDs
- **Cross-Service Latency**: Time for requests to flow between services
- **Log Correlation Rate**: Percentage of logs with correlation context
- **Metrics Collection Rate**: Prometheus scrape success rate
- **Health Check Correlation**: Health endpoint correlation support

## ?? Production Observability Guide

### **Monitoring Setup**

```bash
# Production observability deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d

# Verify observability stack
curl http://localhost:9090/targets  # Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:6000/metrics  # Gateway metrics
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics  # Inventory metrics  
curl http://localhost:5001/metrics  # Sales metrics
```

### **Correlation Best Practices**

1. **?? Always Include Correlation IDs**: Every external request should include correlation headers
2. **?? Log Correlation Context**: Include correlation IDs in all business logic logs
3. **?? Propagate Across Services**: Ensure correlation flows through all service calls
4. **?? Monitor Correlation Coverage**: Track percentage of requests with correlation
5. **?? Alert on Missing Correlation**: Monitor for requests without correlation tracking
